# iTP+xPTP
Repository for the iTP and xPTP replacement policies for TLB anc L2.   The iTP policy prioritizes instruction over data translations, while xPTP supplements iTP as a L2 cache replacement that leverages the increase in page walks due to data translations.

 ## Dependencies

TODO:

===== Installation =====

Clone this repository to deploy the artifact evaluation workflow infrastructure:
	
	clone git https://github.com/dchasap/itp_asplos25_AE.git

To prepare the simualtion environment run:

	source env.sh

The env.sh scripts can be edited to setupe a custom directory tree.

To download and deploy the necessary application traces run the following script:

	./dowload_traces.sh qualcomm_srv

Optinally to download the SPEC CPU 2006/2017 workloads run the following:

	./download_traces.sh spec

If no arguments are passed then both Qualcomm and SPEC will be downloaded.

TODO: manuall installation


===== Running experiments to collect data =====

First prepare the simulation environment, if not done already.

	source env.sh

To collect the necessary experimental data to recreate the most improtant plots, simply run the following command:
  
  ./submit_expriments.sh AE

If only a specific figure is needed, then run the scripts providing an argument with the word fig_N, where N is the two digits number of the figure as presented in the paper:
  
  ./submit_expriments.sh fig_08

To run all experiments just run ./submit_expriments.sh without any arguments.  This is not recommended as the number of jobs generated will probably exceed SLURM's queue limit.

===== Parsing and plotting data =====

To parse and plot the raw data generated by running an experiment, run the following scripts:
  
  ./gen_plots.sh AE

If a specific plot is required, then provide an argument with the word fig_N, where N is the two digit number of the figure as presented in the paper:
  
  ./gen_plots.sh fig_01

If run without any arguments, all plots will be genrated.  Note however that this steps assumes the corresponding experiments have been run.


===== Examining the results =====

The resulting figures will be placed in the figures directory, if the default directory tree has been used.  The directory figurs_PUBLISHED contains pre-generatad figures with the expected results that can be used for comparison.
