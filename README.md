# iTP+xPTP
Repository for the iTP and xPTP replacement policies for TLB anc L2.   The iTP policy prioritizes instruction over data translations, while xPTP supplements iTP as a L2 cache replacement that leverages the increase in page walks due to data translations.

## Dependencies

SLURM job manager

GCC

Python >= 3.0

python packages:

* zenodo_get
* argparse
* pandas
* scipy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Installation 

Clone this repository to deploy the artifact evaluation workflow infrastructure:
	
	clone git https://github.com/dchasap/itp_asplos25_AE.git

To prepare the simualtion environment run:

	cd itp_asplos25_AE
	source env.sh

The env.sh scripts can be edited to setupe a custom directory tree.

To download and deploy the necessary application traces run the following script:

	./dowload_traces.sh qualcomm_srv

Optinally to download the SPEC CPU 2006/2017 workloads run the following:

	./download_traces.sh spec

If no arguments are passed then both Qualcomm and SPEC will be downloaded.

Alternatively, to manually deploy the traces create the corresponding directories in traces:

	mkdir -p ./traces/qualcomm_srv
 	mkdir -p ./traces/spec
Download the Qualcomm Sever and SPEC CPU 2006/2017 workloads from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10959704,  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10959704 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10960003, and extract them in their corresponding directories.  The ./traces/qualcomm_srv and ./traces/spec directories should contain the *.champsimtrace.xz files. 

## Running experiments to collect data

First prepare the simulation environment, if not done already:

	cd itp_asplos25_AE
	source env.sh

To collect the necessary experimental data to recreate the most improtant plots, simply run the following command:
  
  	./submit_expriments.sh AE

If only a specific figure is needed, then run the scripts providing an argument with the word fig_N, where N is the two digits number of the figure as presented in the paper:
  
  	./submit_expriments.sh fig_08

To run all experiments just run ./submit_expriments.sh without any arguments.  This is not recommended as the number of jobs generated will probably exceed SLURM's queue limit.

## Parsing and plotting data

To parse and plot the raw data generated by running an experiment, run the following scripts:
  
	./gen_plots.sh AE

If a specific plot is required, then provide an argument with the word fig_N, where N is the two digit number of the figure as presented in the paper:
  
  	./gen_plots.sh fig_01

If run without any arguments, all plots will be genrated.  Note however that this steps assumes the corresponding experiments have been run.


## Examining the results

The resulting figures will be placed in the figures directory, if the default directory tree has been used.  The directory figurs_PUBLISHED contains pre-generatad figures with the expected results that can be used for comparison.
