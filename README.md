# iTP+xPTP
Repository for the iTP and xPTP replacement policies for TLB anc L2.   The iTP policy prioritizes instruction over data translations, while xPTP supplements iTP as a L2 cache replacement that leverages the increase in page walks due to data translations.


===== Running experiments to collect data =====
To collect the necessary experimental data to recreate the plots, simply run the following command:
  
  ./submit_expriments.sh 

This will run all experiments, if only a specific figure is needed, then run the scripts providing an argument with the word fig_N, where N is the two digits number of the figure as presented in the paper:
  
  ./submit_expriments.sh fig_01

===== Parsing and plotting data =====
To parse and plot the raw data generated by running an experiment, run the following scripts:
  
  ./gen_plots.sh 

If a specific plot is required, then provide an argument with the word fig_N, where N is the two digit number of the figure as presented in the paper:
  
  ./gen_plots.sh fig_01

===== Examining the results =====
The resulting figures that should match the ones presented in the paper are stored in the ./figures directory.
